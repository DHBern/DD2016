Today we are going to run through the same data queries as last week, only now we are going to use Python. It's going to look like magic, but at the end of the class we will look briefly at how it is really only sufficiently advanced technology.\n",

    "The key to this wonderful ease of querying a database without SQL lies in *object-relationship mapping*, or ORM for short. SQLAlchemy is an ORM tool for Python; just about every programming language will have at least one ORM tool of its own. Let's have a look at the hollywood library that I wrote, and that we've been using. It will be some time before everything here makes sense, but here are a few main points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A normal table (i.e. any table that has more than just foreign keys in it) is a class.\n",
    "* You link class attributes (e.g. a Person's \"name\" to rows with the Column() call.\n",
    "* You link foreign keys together with the relationship() call.\n",
    "* This thing called an *association proxy* is how we handle joining tables that have only foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Why can't SQLAlchemy just read the SQL database schema and make the classes automatically, without me having to repeat all this information, you might ask yourself? The answer is that there is a way to do that, but my experiments suggest that it doesn't entirely work yet. I fully expect that in the near future you won't have to write even this much code in order to use a database from Python!)\n",
