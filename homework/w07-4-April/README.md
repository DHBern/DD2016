TEI encoding homework
============

We are going to practice encoding some TEI XML! For this you will want to have the (TEI Guidelines)[http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/] on hand, and particularly chapters 2 and 3. We will be borrowing an exercise from (TEI By Example)[http://teibyexample.org/], which is also a useful resource if you want to learn more about how the TEI works.

Instructions
------

1. Start a new TEI-XML document. I recommend use of the 'simple' version, but it's up to you.
2. Copy the contents of russell_mind.txt into the body of the document.
3. Encode the main structure of this bit of text - paragraphs and page breaks, the chapter of which this is a part, etc.
4. Encode the citation in the footnote. See (here)[http://teibyexample.org/modules/TBED01v00.htm#notes] for details on how to do this.
5. Encode any quotations.
6. Encode any terms that seem to be emphasized or mentioned specially.
7. Create a suitable TEI header for the document, based on this information: "Images taken from the Internet Archive's facsimile edition of Russel, Bertrand, The Analysis of Mind London: George Allen and Unwin Ltd., New York: The MacMillan Company, 1924. p. 198-200. Facsimile edition made available by the Internet Archive at http://www.archive.org/details/analysisofmind00russ."
8. Save your XML file into a directory called 'Homework4' in your own Git repository.
9. Add the file, commit, and push your repository to Github.
