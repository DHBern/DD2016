XML structuring homework
=========

In this folder you will find a photocopy of a short story. The text of the story is in the file "tba.txt", so that you don't have to re-type it! Your task is to turn this into a well-formed XML document, with any markup you choose that represents in digital form what you see or read in the letter. 

Instructions
------------

1. Open Oxygen; create a new XML document. Make a document element called `<story>`. 

2. Paste the contents of the `tba.txt` file inside this root element.

3. Add XML elements and attributes, as we learned in class, to represent what you think might be interesting about the text based on the images. You should be able to think of around ten different sorts of information that someone might care about, each of which would be indicated with its own XML element.

4. Make sure that Oxygen's green box is showing!

5. Save the XML file in a folder called 'Homework3' in your DigitalData Github repository.
